# Project Overview
This project involves:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the data distribution, relationships, and visualizing trends.
- Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality. Various models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were explored.
- Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#Getting Started
To run the code in this project, youâ€™ll need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
