# Project Overview
This project involves:
1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the data distribution, relationships, and visualizing trends.
3. Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to predict wine quality. Various models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were explored.
4.Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#Getting Started
To run the code in this project, youâ€™ll need:
-Python 3.x
-Jupyter Notebook (optional)
-Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
